CommonJ − JSR 237 Timer & WorkManager
=============

Foo-CommonJ is a JSR 237 Timer and WorkManager implementation. It is designed to be used in containers that do not come with their own implementation – mainly plain servlet containers like Tomcat. It can also be used in fully blown JEE applications servers that do not have a WorkManager API or have a non-standard API like JBoss.

Initial implementation : http://commonj.myfoo.de/
