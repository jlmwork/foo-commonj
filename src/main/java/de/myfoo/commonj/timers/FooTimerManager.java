/**
 * Implementation of the TimerManager.  
 * Each of the TimerManager schedule methods returns a Timer object.  
 * The returned Timer can then be queried and/or canceled. Applications 
 * are required to implement the TimerListener interface and may optionally 
 * implement one or both of the CancelTimerListener and StopTimerListener 
 * interfaces.
 * 
 * <p>
 * All Timers execute in the same JVM as the thread that created
 * the Timer and are transient. If the JVM fails then all Timers will be lost.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Recurring timers will execute their TimerListener multiple times.  
 * Invocations of the TimerListener are executed serially. That is, 
 * if a timer is scheduled to repeat every 5 seconds and a previous 
 * execution is still running, then the subsequent execution is delayed 
 * until the currently running execution completes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A TimerListener scheduled multiple times, resulting in the return of 
 * multiple Timer instances, may execute concurrently depending on 
 * implementation. Proper thread safety techniques need to be employed.
 * 
 * <p> 
 * Two types of repeating timers are available:
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>fixed-rate</strong> - 
 * TimerListeners are executed at a constant rate based on the 
 * initial scheduled execution time. Each subsequent execution time 
 * is based off of the period and the first execution time. 
 * This is appropriate for recurring activities that are sensitive to absolute 
 * time, such as ringing a chime every hour on the hour. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * If a fixed-rate execution is delayed for any reason (such as garbage collection, 
 * suspension, or other background activity), 
 * the late TimerListener will execute one time immediately, and then again at the next 
 * scheduled fixed-rate time.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, if a fixed-rate timer was to execute every hour on the hour 
 * and missed 5 executions because the TimerManager was suspended for over 
 * 5 hours,  when the TimerManager is resumed, the TimerListener will 
 * run once immediately, and each execution thereafter will be on the hour.
 * 
 * <li><strong>fixed-delay</strong> - 
 * TimerListeners are executed at a constant delay based on the
 * actual execution time.  Each subsequent execution time is based off of the period 
 * and the end time of the previous execution.  The period is the delay in between 
 * TimerListener executions.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If a fixed-delay execution is delayed for any reason (such as garbage 
 * collection, suspension, or other background activity), subsequent executions 
 * will be delayed as well. In the long run, the frequency of execution will 
 * generally be slightly lower than the reciprocal of the specified period 
 * (assuming the system clock underlying Object.wait(long) is accurate). 
 * </ul>
