/**
 * Implementation of a WorkManager. The WorkManager is the abstraction for 
 * dispatching and monitoring asynchronous work and is a factory
 * for creating application short or long lived Works.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This WorkManager does not support remoting works. However,
 * applications that follow the programming model will work. 
 * Serializable Works will be executed within the local JVM but the 
 * <code>WorkItem</code> can safely be down-casted to a 
 * <code>RemoteWorkItem</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the scheduled <code>Work</code> is a daemon Work, then the life-cycle of 
 * that Work is tied to the application that scheduled it. If the application is 
 * stopped, the <code>Work.release()</code> method will be called.
 *
